ðŸ”’ Dual Microcontroller-Based Door Locker Security System
Project Description
This project develops a secure and efficient smart door control system utilizing a dual-microcontroller architecture. The system features password authentication, data storage in external EEPROM, and integration with a PIR sensor, H-bridge motor control, and a buzzer for enhanced security and functionality. The primary objective is to provide a robust and user-friendly access control solution. 

Key Features
Dual Microcontroller Design: Employs an HMI_ECU (Human-Machine Interface) and a Control_ECU for distributed processing and enhanced reliability. 

Password Authentication: Secure password verification and storage in external EEPROM. 

User Interface: Intuitive interaction via an LCD and keypad for password entry and system management. 

UART Communication: Seamless data exchange between the HMI_ECU and Control_ECU using UART. 
Motorized Door Control: The door's locking/unlocking mechanism is controlled by a motor driven by an H-bridge circuit. 

Buzzer Alerts: Provides auditory warnings for incorrect password attempts and other system alerts. 

PIR Motion Detection: Integrates a PIR sensor to detect motion, influencing door operation states. 

Password Management: Users can change the system password after successful authentication. 
Security Lockout: The system implements a 1-minute lockout period with an active buzzer and error message on the LCD after three consecutive incorrect password attempts.
